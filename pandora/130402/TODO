move gaps to fill, to new TTOM model
add remark on update of zone-inputformat for seaming

Rework network restrictions and maneuver validity

Add numbers
Maybe demo stats?

Implement seaming in TIF2TTOM

Bugfixes on Xmi2Pmf

mention previous review bigbang on 3.12

later points on ttom 3.12

traffic signs: short intro (for who, how, when, where?), good cooperation

add populated tables in network lane information layer

risk: mention the more layers we add the more changes will need to happen on TTOM update.
